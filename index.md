# **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic discovered in my domain is the application of various causal-discovery/learn algorithms. We learned how these algorithm works and how to tune their parameters through the process of applying them on our simulated dataset.

# **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
Our group decides to apply causal-discovery/inference algorithms to real world datasets instead of the simulated one we used in this Quarter. However, our group has not made a decision on what dataset to use in Quarter 2's project, because real world dataset are always messy and requires huge amount of time on data cleaning, so we are still searching for an optimal real world dataset to see the performance of causal discovery/inference algorithm's performance on that dataset. We may even need to perform web scraping to collect suitable dataset by ourselves. We will reach an agreement when writing the Quarter 2 project proposal.

# **What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
We mainly compared and contrasted advantages and disadvantages of causal-discovery/inference algorithms in this quarter, we will try to use these algorithms and potentially improve these algorithms in next quarter. Also the dataset we use in this Quarter is simulated by ourselves, so we naturally have the groundtrth graoh to use to compare various causal discovery/inference algorithms' performances. Nonetheless, we will not have that advantage next quarter, so we need to use other evaluation methods on those algorithm's performances.

# **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I am interested in using deep learning techiniques to help us fine tune parameters of our algorithm. We mainly use trail and error method to find optimal hyperparameters now, and I am interested in using a more efficient method on tuning causal discovery/inference algorithms' hyperparameters.
