# **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic discovered in my domain is the application of various causal-discovery/learn algorithms.

---

# **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
Our group decides to apply causal-discovery/inference algorithms to real world datasets instead of the simulated one we used in this Quarter.

---

# **What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
We mainly compareed and contrasted advantages and disadvantages of causal-discovery/inference algorithms in this quarter, we will try to use these algorithms and potentially improve these algorithms in next quarter.

---

# **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I am interested in using deep learning techiniques to help us fine tune parameters of our algorithm.
